This project provides a Python-based CLI tool to manage AWS EC2 instances
using the AWS CLI internally.

The script supports the following EC2 operations:
- start
- stop
- reboot
- terminate

It authenticates to AWS by exporting credentials as environment variables,
executes AWS CLI commands via Python, monitors instance state transitions,
and finally prints instance details such as:
- Instance ID
- Name tag
- State
- Private IP
- Public IP

The script is useful for learning AWS automation, CLI integration,
and instance lifecycle management without using boto3.
